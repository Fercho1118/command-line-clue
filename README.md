# Mystery in the Small Town: A Command Line Investigation Game

Welcome, Detective! A crime has occurred in our small town, and we need your command line investigation skills to solve it. You'll explore different locations, gather clues, and use your powers of deduction to find the culprit.

## The Crime

A crime has been committed in our quiet town. The police have narrowed down the list of suspects and potential weapons, but they need your help to identify the perpetrator and the murder weapon. The crime must have taken place in an empty room, as no one in town witnessed the act.

## How to Investigate

### Using the Detective's Notebook

When you start the game, you'll find a `notebook.md` file in your game directory. This notebook contains:
- A list of possible suspects
- A list of potential weapons

As you investigate, you'll cross out suspects and weapons that you find in various locations. The logic is simple: if you find a person or object in a room, they couldn't have been involved in the crime at that time! For example, if you find "The Librarian" in the library, you can cross them off your suspect list.

In your notebook, cross out each eliminated suspect and weapon by changing:
```markdown
- [ ] The Librarian
```
to:
```markdown
- [x] The Librarian
 El asesinato fue cometido en el jardín de la mansión por el banquero con un vaso de cristal.
